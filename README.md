## Project Name
**Project:** Landing Page Project

## Project Description
**Project Summary**

This project aims to give us **real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM**. The functionality we will be using serves two purposes: to prepare us for *appending dynamically added data to the DOM*, and to show us *how javascript can improve the usability* of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

**Technologies**

- HTML
